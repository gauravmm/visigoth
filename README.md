# VISIGOTH

This is the bug and feature tracker for the VISIGOTH visit-day scheduler. You can [see the current state of the software](https://github.com/gauravmm/visigoth/issues) without logging in.

We also include a [wiki](https://github.com/gauravmm/visigoth/wiki) which will eventually include documentation and frequently asked questions.

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug in VISIGOTH, please report it to us so we can fix it! Bug reports should include the exact steps needed, avoid mentioning any private data, and should describe the expected output. (for a bonus cookie, use the [Problem Reporter](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22878/windows-10-record-steps) utility on Windows, it captures your screen).

You can submit bug reports here, using the issues tab. If they contain private information, you can either email the bug report or just the private information to me at `gaurav_manek@cmu.edu`.

## Feature Requests

We accept feature requests, though development resources are limited and bugfixes take priority over feature requests.

Feature requests should include a *user story*, an example scenario in which it will be useful. Submit them as issues or by email to `gaurav_manek@cmu.edu`.
